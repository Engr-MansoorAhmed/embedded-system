This project demonstrates LED brightness control using a potentiometer simulated in SimulIDE.
A DC voltage source (battery) supplies power to the circuit, while the potentiometer acts as a variable resistor to adjust the voltage applied across the LED. 
By rotating the potentiometer, the circuit resistance changes, causing a corresponding variation in the current flowing through the LED. 
As a result, the LED brightness increases or decreases smoothly. 
This project illustrates fundamental analog electronics concepts, including voltage division, current control, and resistive regulation of LED intensity.
